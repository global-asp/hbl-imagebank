# HBL Image Bank

This is a repository of open-licensed images derived from the stories in the [Hambaanglaang Cantonese Graded Readers](http://hambaanglaang.hk) (冚唪唥粵文讀本) collection.

## Source

The image bank was created as a side effect of generating the stories for the Global HamBaangLaang Books Project.

## Image sizes

As the original images are quite large (totalling 1 GB in size), they have been resized in this repository for convenient use in other applications. Original size images are available on request.

## Attribution

A list of all source links, illustrator names, and individual licenses for each story can be found in the [SOURCES](SOURCES.md) file.

## License

All images in this repository have been released under a Creative Commons license. Note that the specific Creative Commons license differs for each story -- see [SOURCES](SOURCES.md) for details.
